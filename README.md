# CPU Shadertoy
Run shadertoy shaders on CPU with multithreading and SIMD. Just for fun and learning about [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/), the Intel SPMD program compiler.

With this project, you can just copy and paste shadertoy shaders, run it on CPU with **no** or **little** modification, and get high performance.

This project is highly inspired from zigguratvertigo's [hlsl-to-ispc](https://github.com/zigguratvertigo/hlsl-to-ispc).

This project is still incomplete and working in progress.
